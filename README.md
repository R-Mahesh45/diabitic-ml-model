# Diabetic Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a **Diabetes Prediction Model** using a sample diabetic dataset. The goal is to predict diabetic outcomes based on various health indicators. The model employs **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification and utilizes **Pandas** for data preprocessing and cleaning. Insights from the data are visualized using **Matplotlib**, which enhances the understanding of patterns and trends.

## Objective

- Develop a model that can predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes.
- Improve the accuracy of predictions and decision-making for healthcare professionals.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection:** A sample diabetic dataset was used for model training and evaluation.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Data was cleaned and prepared using **Pandas**.
  - Missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns were handled to make the data ready for analysis.
- **Model Building:**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** was used as the classification model.
  - The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset and tested for accuracy.
- **Visualization:** 
  - **Matplotlib** was used for visualizing key insights from the data, including distributions and correlations.
  
## Impact

- The model provides improved accuracy in predicting diabetic outcomes.
- It can serve as a tool for healthcare professionals to enhance decision-making and identify patients at risk for diabetes.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Core programming language)
- **Pandas** (Data preprocessing and cleaning)
- **Matplotlib** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (SVM model and other ML utilities)
